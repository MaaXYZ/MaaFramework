# 2.4 Control Methods

This document provides detailed explanations of the various Screencap (screenshot) and Input (control) methods in MaaFramework and their configurations.

> [!TIP]
>
> - For APIs, screencap/input uses `int` type (bitwise OR combination); for [ProjectInterface V2](3.3-ProjectInterfaceV2.md), use `string` type (use the name directly).
> - [ProjectInterface V2](3.3-ProjectInterfaceV2.md) only supports configuring screencap/mouse/keyboard methods for Win32 controllers. For Adb controllers, screencap/input uses `MaaToolkitAdbDeviceFind` to automatically detect and select the optimal method, no manual configuration required.

## Adb

### Adb Input

> Reference: [MaaDef.h](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/include/MaaFramework/MaaDef.h#L227-L240)

Combine the selected methods below using **bitwise OR** to provide a single value. MaaFramework will try all provided methods in a fixed priority order and select the first available method.

By default, all methods except EmulatorExtras are attempted.

> Priority: EmulatorExtras > Maatouch > MinitouchAndAdbKey > AdbShell

| Name | API Value | Speed | Compatibility | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AdbShell | `1` | Slow | High | |
| MinitouchAndAdbKey | `2` | Fast | Medium | Key input still uses AdbShell |
| Maatouch | `4` | Fast | Medium | |
| EmulatorExtras | `8` | Fast | Low | Only supports emulators: MuMu 12 |

### Adb Screencap

> Reference: [MaaDef.h](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/include/MaaFramework/MaaDef.h#L208-L225)

Combine the selected methods below using **bitwise OR** to provide a single value. MaaFramework will try all provided methods and select the fastest available method.

By default, all methods except `RawByNetcat`, `MinicapDirect`, and `MinicapStream` are attempted.

`MinicapDirect` and `MinicapStream` encode to jpg (lossy compression), which significantly reduces template matching effectiveness and are not recommended.

| Name | API Value | Speed | Compatibility | Encoding | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EncodeToFileAndPull | `1` | Slow | High | Lossless | |
| Encode | `2` | Slow | High | Lossless | |
| RawWithGzip | `4` | Medium | High | Lossless | |
| RawByNetcat | `8` | Fast | Low | Lossless | |
| MinicapDirect | `16` | Fast | Low | Lossy | |
| MinicapStream | `32` | Very Fast | Low | Lossy | |
| EmulatorExtras | `64` | Very Fast | Low | Lossless | Only supports emulators: MuMu 12, LDPlayer 9, and AVD |

## Win32

### Win32 Input

> Reference: [MaaDef.h](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/include/MaaFramework/MaaDef.h#L252-L259)

Select one of the values below.

No default value. Client can choose one as the default.

Different programs on Win32 handle input differently, so there is no universal method.

| Name | API Value | Compatibility | Requires Admin | Seizes Cursor | Background | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Seize | `1` | High | No | Yes | No | |
| SendMessage | `2` | Medium | Maybe | No | Yes | |
| PostMessage | `4` | Medium | Maybe | No | Yes | |
| LegacyEvent | `8` | Low | No | Yes | No | |
| PostThreadMessage | `16` | Low | Maybe | No | Yes | |
| SendMessageWithCursorPos | `32` | Medium | Maybe | Brief | Yes | Briefly moves cursor to target position then restores, for apps that check real cursor position |
| PostMessageWithCursorPos | `64` | Medium | Maybe | Brief | Yes | Briefly moves cursor to target position then restores, for apps that check real cursor position |
| SendMessageWithWindowPos | `128` | Medium | Maybe | No | Yes | Briefly moves window to align target with cursor then restores, does not seize mouse |
| PostMessageWithWindowPos | `256` | Medium | Maybe | No | Yes | Briefly moves window to align target with cursor then restores, does not seize mouse |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Admin privileges mainly depend on the target program's permission level. If the target program runs as administrator, running with admin privileges is required for compatibility.
> - The `WithCursorPos` methods briefly move the cursor to the target position, then restore it after sending the message, hence "Brief" cursor seizure, but it does not block user operations.
> - The `WithWindowPos` methods briefly move the window so the target position aligns with the current cursor position, then restore the window position after sending the message. The cursor is not moved, so there is no mouse seizure, but the window may briefly flicker.

### Win32 Screencap

> Reference: [MaaDef.h](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/include/MaaFramework/MaaDef.h#L242-L250)

Select one of the values below.

No default value. Client can choose one as the default.

Different programs on Win32 handle rendering differently, so there is no universal method.

| Name | API Value | Speed | Compatibility | Requires Admin | Background | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GDI | `1` | Fast | Medium | No | No | |
| FramePool | `2` | Very Fast | Medium | No | Yes | Available on Windows 10 1903+ |
| DXGI_DesktopDup | `4` | Very Fast | Low | No | No | Desktop duplication (full-screen output copy) |
| DXGI_DesktopDup_Window | `8` | Very Fast | Low | No | No | Desktop duplication cropped to window |
| PrintWindow | `16` | Medium | Medium | No | Yes | |
| ScreenDC | `32` | Fast | High | No | No | |
| FramePoolWithPseudoMinimize | `64` | Very Fast | Medium | No | Yes | Available on Windows 10 1903+, supports pseudo-minimize |
| PrintWindowWithPseudoMinimize | `128` | Medium | Medium | No | Yes | Supports pseudo-minimize |

> [!NOTE]
>
> Windows stops rendering window content when a window is minimized. Most screenshot methods cannot capture valid content from minimized windows.
> To capture minimized windows, use the `PseudoMinimize` variants. These methods make the window transparent and click-through, then restore it without activation, allowing screencap to continue without disturbing the user.

## PlayCover (macOS)

The PlayCover controller is used to control iOS applications running via [fork PlayCover](https://github.com/hguandl/PlayCover/releases) on macOS.

### PlayCover Prerequisites

1. Install [fork PlayCover](https://github.com/hguandl/PlayCover/releases) on macOS
2. Target iOS app must have MaaTools feature enabled in PlayCover

## Gamepad (Windows)

The Gamepad controller is used to emulate Xbox 360 or DualShock 4 gamepad input on Windows, suitable for games that require gamepad control.

### Gamepad Prerequisites

[ViGEm Bus Driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases) must be installed.

### Gamepad Types

| Type | API Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Xbox360 | `0` | Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller (wired) |
| DualShock4 | `1` | Sony DualShock 4 Controller (wired) |

### Control Mapping

The Gamepad controller uses the following mapping:

#### Digital Buttons (click_key/key_down/key_up)

Use `MaaGamepadButton_*` constants as key values. Xbox button values are used for Xbox360 gamepad, DS4 face buttons automatically map to Xbox equivalents:

| Button | API Value | Xbox 360 | DualShock 4 Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DPAD_UP | `1` | D-pad Up | D-pad Up |
| DPAD_DOWN | `2` | D-pad Down | D-pad Down |
| DPAD_LEFT | `4` | D-pad Left | D-pad Left |
| DPAD_RIGHT | `8` | D-pad Right | D-pad Right |
| START / OPTIONS | `16` | Start | Options |
| BACK / SHARE | `32` | Back | Share |
| LEFT_THUMB / L3 | `64` | Left Stick Press | L3 |
| RIGHT_THUMB / R3 | `128` | Right Stick Press | R3 |
| LB / L1 | `256` | LB | L1 |
| RB / R1 | `512` | RB | R1 |
| GUIDE | `1024` | Xbox Guide | - |
| A / CROSS | `4096` | A | ✗ (Cross) |
| B / CIRCLE | `8192` | B | ○ (Circle) |
| X / SQUARE | `16384` | X | □ (Square) |
| Y / TRIANGLE | `32768` | Y | △ (Triangle) |
| PS | `65536` | - | PS (DS4 only) |
| TOUCHPAD | `131072` | - | Touchpad Press (DS4 only) |

#### Analog Input (touch_down/touch_move/touch_up)

Use the `contact` parameter to select the control target:

| Contact | Description | x/y Range | pressure Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Left Stick | -32768 ~ 32767 | Ignored |
| 1 | Right Stick | -32768 ~ 32767 | Ignored |
| 2 | Left Trigger (LT/L2) | Ignored | 0 ~ 255 |
| 3 | Right Trigger (RT/R2) | Ignored | 0 ~ 255 |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - ViGEm Bus Driver must be installed to use this controller.
