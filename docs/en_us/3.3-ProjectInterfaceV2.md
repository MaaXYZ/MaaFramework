# 3.3 Project Interface V2

> **Note:** This document is about the creation and usage of `ProjectInterface`.
>
> In this document, **PI** refers to `ProjectInterface` and **Client** refers to the tool that can process PI.

## Introduction

The so-called `ProjectInterface` is a standardized project structure declaration for MaaFramework. It currently consists of a single file, `interface.json`. By defining a PI, you can leverage various derivative tools of MaaFramework. Therefore, even if you intend to integrate solely using a general-purpose programming language, it is recommended to define a PI containing the basic information.

> [!TIP]
>
> You can find general UI and other tools that use PI in the [Community Projects](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/README_en.md#community-project) section.

### Version Notes

Due to the rapid iteration of business development, the release schedule of MaaFramework cannot be properly aligned with the iteration pace of the PI. Therefore, PI will have its own separate version control, and its version number will not be completely synchronized with the MaaFramework release version number.

We have designated the version number for the independent release (January 30, 2026) as `v2.1.0`. Subsequent additions and fixes will be marked with version numbers in the documentation.

| Date       | Version | Changes        |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2026-01-30 | v2.1.0  | Standalone release |
| 2026-01-30 | v2.2.0  | Added `attach_resource_path` and `import` fields |
| 2026-02-23 | v2.3.0  | Added `checkbox` multi-select type, `option.controller`, `option.resource`, global/resource/controller-level options, `focus.display` display channel tag, `preset` field, `import` supports importing `preset` |

## `interface.json`

> [!TIP]
>
> This file can be validated and receive hints via the [schema](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/tools/interface.schema.json) file.
>
> When opening the project template folder with VSCode, the schema and file will be automatically associated.

### Overall Structure

- **interface_version** `number`  
  The interface version number, currently 2, fixed and required. Used to identify the ProjectInterface protocol version.

- **languages** `object`  
  Multi-language support configuration. Keys are language codes, values are paths to corresponding translation files. If not specified, only Chinese is supported by default.  
  File paths are relative to the directory containing interface.json.

  ```jsonc
  "languages": {
      "zh_cn": "interface_zh.json",
      "en_us": "interface_en.json"
  }
  ```

- **name** `string`  
  The unique project identifier, used as the project ID.

- **label** `string`  
  The project display name, shown in the user interface. Supports internationalized strings (starting with `$`). If not set, the value of the `name` field is displayed. _Optional._

  ```jsonc
  {
    "name": "MyProject",
    "label": "$project_name"  // Internationalized project name
  }
  ```

- **title** `string`  
  The window title. The Client will display this content directly without additional decoration. _Optional_, defaults to a combination of `name` and `version`. Supports internationalization (starting with `$`).

  - **child_exec** `string`  
    The subprocess path, an executable file available in the system path. For example, if the Python path exists in the environment variables (system or user), you can simply write `"python"`.  
    CWD is the directory containing interface.json.

  - **child_args** `string[]`  
    _Optional._ An array of arguments for the subprocess.

  - **identifier** `string`  
    _Optional._ A connection identifier used to create a communication socket. If provided, it will be used; otherwise, one is created automatically.

  - **name** `string`  
    Unique task identifier, used as the task ID.

  - **label** `string`  
    Task display name, shown in the user interface. Supports internationalized strings (starting with `$`). If not set, the value of the `name` field is displayed. _Optional._

  - **entry** `string`  
    The task entry, which is the name of the `Task` in the `pipeline`.

  - **default_check** `boolean`  
    Whether this task is selected by default. _Optional_, defaults to false. The Client will use this value to determine whether to check this task by default during initialization.

  - **description** `string`  
    Detailed task description to help users understand the task's functionality. Supports file paths, URLs, or direct text. Content supports Markdown format. _Optional._

  - **icon** `string`

  - **resource** `string[]`  
    _Optional._ Specifies the list of resource packages supported by this task. Array elements should correspond to the `name` field in the `resource` configuration. If not specified, this task is available in all resource packages.

    When a user selects a resource package, the Client may hide tasks that do not support that resource package, or display them in a disabled (grayed-out) state to inform the user. This allows providing specialized task configurations for different resource packages, such as event tasks that are only available in specific resource packages.

    ```jsonc
    "task": [
        {
            "name": "EventTask",
            "label": "$EventTask",
            "entry": "ActivityTask",
            "resource": ["Official"],
            "description": "Event task only available in the Official resource package"
        },
        {
            "name": "CommonTask",
            "label": "$CommonTask",
            "entry": "CommonTask"
        }
    ]
    ```

  - **controller** `string[]`  
    _Optional._ Specifies the list of controller types supported by this task. Array elements should correspond to the `name` field in the `controller` configuration. If not specified, this task is available for all controller types.

    When a user selects a controller, the Client may hide tasks that do not support that controller, or display them in a disabled (grayed-out) state to inform the user. This allows providing specialized task configurations for different controller types, such as tasks that are only available for Adb controllers or Win32 controllers.

    ```jsonc
    "task": [
        {
            "name": "AndroidOnlyTask",
            "label": "$AndroidOnlyTask",
            "entry": "AndroidSpecificTask",

            "description": "Task only available for Android controllers"
        },
        {
            "name": "Win32OnlyTask",
            "label": "$Win32OnlyTask",
            "entry": "Win32SpecificTask",
            "controller": ["Win32Emulator"],
            "description": "Task only available for Win32 controllers"
        },
        {
            "name": "CommonTask",
            "label": "$CommonTask",
            "entry": "CommonTask"
        }
    ]
    ```

  - **pipeline_override** `pipeline`  
    _Optional._ Task parameters that [override](#resource-override) the loaded resources when executing the task. This structure is exactly the same as the JSON file in the `pipeline` and must include the task name part, for example:

    ```jsonc
    "pipeline_override": {
        "Quit": {
            "enabled": true
        }
    }
    ```

  - **option** `string[]`  
    _Optional._ Task configuration options, an array containing keys from subsequent `option` objects. The Client will prompt the user to make selections based on these.

    The Client can display the options in the order provided in the `option` array.

- **option** `record<string, object>`  
  Definition of configuration options, an object mapping containing information about each option.

  - _**key**_  
    Unique name identifier; tasks will reference this name.

  - **type** `string`  
    The option type. _Optional_, defaults to `"select"`. Valid values:

    - `"input"`: User input field, allows manual input  
    - `"switch"`: Toggle switch, Yes or No

  - **controller** `string[]` **💡 v2.3.0**  
    _Optional._ Specifies the list of controller types this option applies to. Array elements should correspond to the `name` field in the `controller` configuration. If not specified, this option is available for all controller types.  
    When a user selects a controller, the Client may hide options that do not apply to that controller, or display them in a disabled (grayed-out) state to inform the user.

  - **resource** `string[]` **💡 v2.3.0**  
    _Optional._ Specifies the list of resource packages this option applies to. Array elements should correspond to the `name` field in the `resource` configuration. If not specified, this option is available for all resource packages.  
    When a user selects a resource package, the Client may hide options that do not apply to that resource package, or display them in a disabled (grayed-out) state to inform the user.

  - **label** `string`  
    Option display label, shown in the user interface. Supports internationalized strings (starting with `$`). _Optional._

  - **description** `string`

    Used only when `type` is `"select"`, `"checkbox"`, or `"switch"`. Available options, an array of objects containing information about each option.

    **Note:** When `type` is `"checkbox"`, the user can select multiple cases simultaneously. The `pipeline_override` of all selected cases will be merged in the order they appear in the `cases` array — regardless of the order in which the user checked them.

    **Note:** When `type` is `"switch"`, only two cases are supported, and the following rules must be followed:  
    - If `case.name` is one of `"Yes"`, `"yes"`, `"Y"`, or `"y"`, that case will be recognized as the **Yes option**  
    - If `case.name` is one of `"No"`, `"no"`, `"N"`, or `"n"`, that case will be recognized as the **No option**  
    - The Client will match the user's Y/N input based on the case's name, and other inputs will prompt the user to re-enter

    It is recommended to use `"Yes"` and `"No"` as the names of the two cases to ensure consistency across different Clients.

    The Client can display the options in the order provided in the `cases` array.

    - **name** `string`  
      Unique option identifier, used as the option ID.

              { "name": "Event: Stage 17 Hard (Event Ended)", "enabled": false }
          ]
      },
      {
          "name": "RealtimeAssist",

              {

                  }
              }
          ]
      }
  ]
  ```

  **Managing presets across files via `import`:**

  Preset configurations can be split into separate files via `import` for easier management and reuse. For example:

  ```jsonc
  // interface.json
  {
      "import": [
          "preset_daily.json",
          "preset_realtime.json"
      ],
      "preset": [
          // Presets can also be defined directly in the main file and will be merged with imported presets
      ]
  }
  ```

  ```jsonc
  // preset_daily.json
  {
      "preset": [
          {
              "name": "DailyRoutine",
              "label": "$DailyRoutine",
              "description": "Daily routine package",
              "task": [
                  { "name": "Collect Wilderness", "enabled": true },
                  { "name": "Claim Rewards", "enabled": true }
              ]
          }
      ]
  }
  ```

### Option Override Order **💡 v2.3.0**

The `pipeline_override` generated by each level of option is merged in the following order — **later-merged fields override earlier ones with the same key name**:

1. `global_option` — global options, applied first, lowest priority
2. `resource.option` — resource-level options
3. `controller.option` — controller-level options
4. `task.option` — task-level options, applied last, highest priority

In other words: `task.option` > `controller.option` > `resource.option` > `global_option`.

The reasoning behind this design is that more specific configuration (task-level) should have higher priority, while more general configuration (global-level) serves as the fallback default.

**Example:**

If both `global_option` and a `task.option` reference the same option, and that option's cases make different overrides to the same pipeline node, the task-level override will take final effect.

### Option Examples

#### Select Type Option Example

```jsonc
{
  "option": {
    "BattleStage": {
      "type": "select",
      "label": "$SelectBattleStage",
      "description": "Select the stage to farm",
      "default_case": "3-9 Dire",
      "cases": [
        {
          "name": "3-9 Dire (Lark)",
          "label": "$3-9Dire",
          "description": "Farm Lark",
          "icon": "lark.png",
          "option": [
            "UseSanityPotion",
            "AfterFarmingXXX"
          ],
          "pipeline_override": {
            "EnterTheShow": {
              "next": "MainChapter_3"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Input Type Option Example

```jsonc
{
  "option": {
    "CustomStage": {
      "type": "input",
      "label": "Custom Stage",
      "description": "Choose which stage to play",
      "icon": "wrench.png",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "ChapterNumber",
          "label": "$ChapterNumber",
          "description": "Stage chapter number, use Arabic numerals",
          "default": "4",
          "pipeline_type": "string",
          "verify": "^\\d+$"
        },
        {
          "name": "Timeout",
          "label": "$Timeout",
          "description": "Wait timeout duration",
          "default": "20000",
          "pipeline_type": "int",
          "verify": "^\\d+$"
        }
      ],
      "pipeline_override": {
        "EnterTheShow": {
          "next": "MainChapter_{ChapterNumber}",
          "timeout": "{Timeout}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Checkbox Type Option Example 💡 v2.3.0

```jsonc
{
  "option": {
    "BattleFeatures": {
      "type": "checkbox",
      "label": "$BattleFeatures",
      "description": "Select the battle features to enable, multiple selections allowed",
      "default_case": ["NormalStrike", "ChargedStrike"],
      "cases": [
        {
          "name": "NormalStrike",
          "label": "$NormalStrike",
          "description": "Enable normal strike",
          "pipeline_override": {
            "NormalMatch": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "ChargedStrike",
          "label": "$ChargedStrike",
          "description": "Enable charged strike",
          "pipeline_override": {
            "ChargedMatch": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "ComboStrike",
          "label": "$ComboStrike",
          "description": "Enable combo strike",
          "pipeline_override": {
            "ComboMatch": {
              "enabled": true
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** In `checkbox` type, the `pipeline_override` of multiple selected cases is merged in the **definition order** of the `cases` array — regardless of the order in which the user checked them.

### Internationalization Support

For all string fields that support internationalization, if the string starts with `$`, it indicates that the string is an internationalized string. The Client needs to read the actual value from the translation file before displaying it.

For example:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "MyDemo3",
  "label": "$MyDemo3",
  "controller": [
    {
      "name": "Android",
      "label": "$Android"
    }
  ]
}
```

Corresponding translation file (e.g., `interface_en.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "MyDemo3": "My Demo 3",
  "Android": "Android Device"
}
```

### Resource Override

If a later-loaded resource contains a task with the same name as one already loaded, the tasks will be merged. Generally, the top-level keys of the new task will replace those of the old task. For example:

Old Task

```jsonc
{
    "task1": {
        "enabled": false,
        "recognition": "DirectHit",
        "next": [ "T1", "T2" ]
    }
}
```

New Task

```jsonc
{
    "task1": {
        "enabled": true,
        "action": "Click",
        "next": [ "T2", "T3" ]
    }
}
```

Merged Task

```jsonc
{
    "task1": {
        "enabled": true,
        "recognition": "DirectHit",
        "action": "Click",
        "next": [ "T2", "T3" ]       // Direct replacement; inner arrays/lists are not merged.
    }
}
```

### Node Notification Handling

MaaFramework sends node notifications via callback functions during task execution. The Client needs to implement the corresponding handling logic to display task execution status to users.

#### Callback Function Signature

The Client needs to register a callback function to receive notifications. For the function signature, refer to [MaaDef.h](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/include/MaaFramework/MaaDef.h):

```c
typedef void(MAA_CALL* MaaEventCallback)(
    void* handle,
    const char* message,
    const char* details_json,
    void* trans_arg
);
```

- **message**: Message type identifier (e.g., `Node.Action.Starting`, `Node.Recognition.Succeeded`, etc.)
- **details_json**: JSON string containing specific data

#### Message Template Mechanism

Resource authors can configure message templates in the Pipeline using the `focus` field. The `focus` field is a dictionary where keys are message types and values are template strings or template objects. Template strings support file paths, URLs, or direct text, content supports Markdown format, and support internationalization (starting with `$`). When the Client receives a callback, it should perform placeholder replacement based on the template and display the result to users via the specified channel.

##### Two Forms of `focus` Values

**Shorthand (plain string):** Equivalent to `display: "log"` — content is only shown in the run log.

```jsonc
"focus": {
    "Node.Action.Starting": "{name} starts execution"
}
```

**Full form (object):** Use the `display` field to specify the display channel. **💡 v2.3.0**

```jsonc
"focus": {
    "Node.Action.Starting": {
        "content": "{name} starts execution",
        "display": "toast"
    }
}
```

##### `display` Values **💡 v2.3.0**

| Value | Description | Behavior |
|----|------|----------|
| `"log"` | Run log (**default**) | Appended to the log stream, non-interrupting |
| `"toast"` | In-app lightweight notification | Briefly appears then auto-dismisses, non-blocking |
| `"notification"` | System-level notification | Pushed to OS notification center, received even when app is in background |
| `"dialog"` | Non-blocking dialog | Popup message box, task pipeline **continues running** in the background |
| `"modal"` | Blocking popup | Task is **paused** until the user confirms — suitable for scenarios requiring manual intervention |

`display` supports arrays so the same message can be pushed to multiple channels simultaneously:

```jsonc
"focus": {
    "Node.Action.Succeeded": {
        "content": "✅ {name} executed successfully",
        "display": ["log", "toast"]
    },
    "Node.Action.Failed": {
        "content": "❌ Execution failed, please check the environment",
        "display": ["log", "modal"]
    }
}
```

**Complete Pipeline Configuration Example:**

```jsonc
{
  "NodeA": {
    "focus": {
      "Node.Recognition.Succeeded": "{name} recognition hit, ready to start execution",
      "Node.Action.Starting": {
        "content": "{name} starts execution, task ID: {task_id}",
        "display": ["log", "toast"]
      },
      "Node.Action.Failed": {
        "content": "{name} execution failed",
        "display": "modal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Callback Function Parameters Example:**

```c
// message parameter:
"Node.Action.Starting"

// details_json parameter (after parsing):
{
    "task_id": 12345,
    "action_id": 11111,
    "name": "NodeA",
    "focus": {
        "Node.Recognition.Succeeded": "{name} recognition hit, ready to start execution",
        "Node.Action.Starting": {
            "content": "{name} starts execution, task ID: {task_id}",
            "display": ["log", "toast"]
        },
        "Node.Action.Failed": {
            "content": "{name} execution failed",
            "display": "modal"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Client Processing Flow

1. Parse the `details_json` parameter in the callback function
2. Check if the parsed object contains a `focus` field
3. If present, find the corresponding template (string or object) in `focus` based on the `message` parameter
4. If the template is a string, treat it as `content` and set `display` to `["log"]`; if it is an object, read `content` and `display` separately
5. Replace placeholders in `content` (e.g., `{name}`, `{task_id}`) with data from `details_json`
6. Display the processed text to the user via the channel(s) specified in `display` (may be multiple) **💡 v2.3.0**

Using the example above, upon receiving `Node.Action.Starting`, the Client should append to the log and show a toast: `NodeA starts execution, task ID: 12345`
