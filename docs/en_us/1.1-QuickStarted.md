# Getting Started

1. Download the MaaFramework Release
2. Prepare Resource Files
3. Use a Generic GUI or Write Integration Code

## Download the MaaFramework Release

Download and extract the MaaFramework release that matches your platform: [Releases](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaFramework/releases)

## Prepare Resource Files

You need to prepare some resource files with the typical file structure as follows:

```tree
my_resource
├── image
│   ├── my_image_1.png
│   └── my_image_2.png
├── model
│   └── ocr
│       ├── det.onnx
│       ├── keys.txt
│       └── rec.onnx
├── pipeline
│   ├── my_pipeline_1.json
│   └── my_pipeline_2.json
└── properties.json
```

You can modify the names of files and folders starting with "my_", but the others have fixed file names and should not be changed. Here's a breakdown:

### Pipeline JSON Files

The files in `my_resource/pipeline` contain the main script execution logic and recursively read all JSON format files in the directory.

You can refer to the [Task Pipeline Protocol](3.1-PipelineProtocol.md) for writing these files. You can find a simple [demo](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaFramework/blob/main/sample/resource/pipeline/sample.json) for reference.

Tools:

- [JSON Schema](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaFramework/blob/main/tools/pipeline.schema.json)
- [Graphical Editor](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaJsonViewer)

### Image Files

The files in `my_resource/image` are primarily used for template matching images, feature detection images, and other images required by the pipeline. They are read based on the `template` and other fields specified in the pipeline.

Tools:

- [Image Cropping and ROI Extraction Tool](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaFramework/tree/main/tools/ImageCropper)

### Text Recognition Model Files

The files in `my_resource/model/ocr` are ONNX models obtained from [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) after conversion.

You can use our pre-converted files: [MaaCommonAssets](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaCommonAssets/tree/main/OCR). Choose the language you need and store them according to the directory structure mentioned above in [Prepare Resource Files](#prepare-resource-files).

If needed, you can also fine-tune the official pre-trained models of PaddleOCR yourself (please refer to the official PaddleOCR documentation) and convert them to ONNX files for use. You can find conversion commands [here](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaCommonAssets/tree/main/OCR#command).

### Directory Property File

`properties.json` can be used to set properties for the current directory. A typical JSON structure is as follows:

_Please note that JSON does not support comments, and the following is for demonstration purposes only. Do not copy and use directly._

```jsonc
{
    "is_base": true,     // Whether it is a base resource
                         // If true, when reading resources in this directory, all previously read content will be cleared.
}
```

## Integration

You can integrate MaaFramework using MaaY (Generic GUI) or by writing integration code yourself.

### Using MaaY

Use [MaaY](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaY). Refer to the corresponding documentation in MaaY to organize the `.maay` folder and directly import and use it in the GUI.

Examples:

- [M9A.maay](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/M9A/tree/main/assets/.maay)
- [MAS.maay](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantSkland/tree/main/.maay)

### Writing Integration Code Yourself

Please refer to the [Integration Documentation](2.1-Integration.md).

Examples:

- [M9A](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/M9A) - Integration practice based on C++ & cmake
- [MBA](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MBA) - Integration practice based on C# .NET
