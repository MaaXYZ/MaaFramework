# Getting Started

You can choose between two development options:

1. Organize resources and write integration code yourself

    More flexible, recommended for developers who have a certain understanding of MaaFW.

2. ⭐Use [Project Template](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaPracticeBoilerplate) and general CLI

    Simple and convenient, recommended for new developers.

## Prepare resource files

*⭐If you plan to use the project template, just modify it directly in [folder](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaPracticeBoilerplate/tree/main/assets/resource/base).*

You need to prepare some resource files with the typical file structure as follows:

```tree
my_resource
├── image
│   ├── my_image_1.png
│   └── my_image_2.png
├── model
│   └── ocr
│       ├── det.onnx
│       ├── keys.txt
│       └── rec.onnx
└── pipeline
    ├── my_pipeline_1.json
    └── my_pipeline_2.json
```

You can modify the names of files and folders starting with "my_", but the others have fixed file names and should not be changed. Here's a breakdown:

### Pipeline JSON Files

The files in `my_resource/pipeline` contain the main script execution logic and recursively read all JSON format files in the directory.

You can refer to the [Task Pipeline Protocol](3.1-PipelineProtocol.md) for writing these files. You can find a simple [demo](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/sample/resource/pipeline/sample.json) for reference.

Tools:

- [JSON Schema](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/tools/pipeline.schema.json)
- [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nekosu.maa-support)

### Image Files

The files in `my_resource/image` are primarily used for template matching images, feature detection images, and other images required by the pipeline. They are read based on the `template` and other fields specified in the pipeline.

Please note that the image used needs to be a lossless crop of the original image. If you use an Android emulator, please use the screenshot function that comes with the emulator! (You cannot directly take screenshots of the emulator window)

Tools:

- [Image Cropping and ROI Extraction Tool](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/tree/main/tools/ImageCropper)

### Text Recognition Model Files

*⭐If you use the project template, just follow its documentation and run `configure.py` to automatically deploy the model file.*

The files in `my_resource/model/ocr` are ONNX models obtained from [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) after conversion.

You can use our pre-converted files: [MaaCommonAssets](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaCommonAssets/tree/main/OCR). Choose the language you need and store them according to the directory structure mentioned above in [Prepare Resource Files](#prepare-resource-files).

If needed, you can also fine-tune the official pre-trained models of PaddleOCR yourself (please refer to the official PaddleOCR documentation) and convert them to ONNX files for use. You can find conversion commands [here](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaCommonAssets/tree/main/OCR#command).

## Debug

- We recommend using [MaaDebugger](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaDebugger).
- If you use MaaPiCli, the `config/maa_option.json` file will be generated in the same directory, including:

  - `logging`: Save the log and generate `debug/maa.log`. Default true.
  - `recording`: Save recording function, which will save all screenshots and operation data during operation. You can use `DbgController` for reproducible debugging. Default false.
  - `save_draw`: Saves the image recognition visualization results. All image recognition visualization results drawings during the run will be saved. Default false.
  - `show_hit_draw`: Displays the task hit pop-up window. Each time the recognition is successful, a pop-up window will display the recognition result. Default false.
  - `stdout_level`: The console displays the log level. The default is 2 (Error), which can be set to 0 to turn off all console logs, or to 7 to turn on all console logs.

- If you integrate it yourself, you can enable debugging options through the `Toolkit.init_option` / `MaaToolkitInitOptionConfig` interface. The generated json file is the same as above.

## Run

You can integrate MaaFramework using MaaPiCli (Generic CLI) or by writing integration code yourself.

### Using MaaPiCli

*⭐If you use the project template, follow its documentation directly and run `install.py` to automatically package the relevant files.*

Use MaaPiCli in the `bin` folder of the Release package, and write `interface.json` and place it in the same directory to use it.

The Cli has completed basic function development, and more functions are being continuously improved! Detailed documentation needs to be further improved. Currently, you can refer to [Sample](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/sample/interface.json) to write it.

Examples:

- [M9A](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/M9A/tree/main/assets/interface.json)

### Writing Integration Code Yourself

Please refer to the [Integration Documentation](2.1-Integration.md).

Examples:

- [MAABH3](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MAABH3) - Integration example based on C++ & cmake
- [MBA](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MBA) - Integration example based on C# .NET
