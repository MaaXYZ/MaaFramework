# Custom Tasks

In addition to writing JSON according to the pipeline protocol for low-code development, MaaFramework also supports various ways to write custom code for implementing tasks:

- [FFI (Foreign Function Interface)](#ffi)  

  MaaFramework provides C and Python API, and in theory, it supports all major languages.  
  However, it is currently only adapted to C and Python. You may need to write other languages ​​by yourself (we also welcome you to submit a PR after completing it!).  
  Advantages: Relatively high execution efficiency, more in line with standard programming paradigms.

- [Executor Agent](#executor-agent)  

  In simple terms, developers can write their own executable (exe) and pass the exe path through MaaToolkit interfaces. When MaaFramework reaches the corresponding task, it calls the exe, passing in the current screen's image, recognization result, task name, and other information as parameters.  
  Developers can perform any operation in their exe and can output commands directly (print / std::cout / ...) following the [protocol](#input-output-protocol). MaaFramework captures these output commands through a pipeline to execute actions such as clicking, sliding, screenshot recognition, etc. The results are then passed back through the pipeline, which can be obtained through standard input (input / std::cin / ...).  
  The term "exe" here refers to any executable file, including exe, bat, shell, Python scripts, etc. (also supports executable files under Linux / macOS).  
  Advantages: Easy to implement.

## FFI

You can implement custom actions and custom recognizers, and pass them to registration interfaces.  
The `SyncContext` can be used to invoke more clicking, sliding, screenshot recognition, etc.

For custom recognizers, the launch parameters are:

```shell

### Input-Output Protocol

All commands executed by the controller proxy are performed synchronously. After each command is executed, the standard input (`input` / `std::cin` / `scanf` / ...) must be used to retrieve the execution results; otherwise, it may affect the execution of subsequent commands.

The command format is JSON with the following general structure:

```jsonc
{
    "function": string,
    "sync_context": string,
    // ......
}
```

- `function`: *string*  
  The executed command, mandatory. Possible values: `RunTask` | `RunRecognizer` | `RunAction` | `Click` | `Swipe` | `PressKey` | `InputText` | `TouchDown` | `TouchMove` | `TouchUp` | `Screencap` | `GetTaskResult`

- `sync_context`: *string*  
  Instance information, mandatory. When launching a custom recognizer/custom action, a string passed in as a launch parameter.

The execution result format is JSON with the following general structure:

```jsonc
