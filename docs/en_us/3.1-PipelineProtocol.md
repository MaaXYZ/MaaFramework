# Pipeline Protocol

## Overview

```jsonc
{
    "TaskA": {
        "next: [
            "TaskB",
            "TaskC"
        ]
        // properties ...
    },
    "TaskB": {
        // properties ...
    },
    // other task ...
}
```

When we execute a task (passing the task name to the MaaTaskerPostPipeline interface), it will recognize the tasks in the "next" list one by one (based on the recognition settings for each task). Once a match is found, it will exit the recognition of the "next" list and proceed to execute the matched task. It's similar to traversing and comparing, and as soon as a match is found, it will break and execute the found task.

## Example

For example, let's say we have a game where different fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, can appear on the screen, and we need to click them. Here's a simple JSON representation:

```jsonc
{
    "StartFruit": {
        "next": [
            "Apple",
            "Orange",
            "Banana"
        ]
    },
    "Apple": {
        "recognition": XXX,
        "action": "Click",
        // ...
    },
    "Orange": {
        "recognition": XXX,
        "action": "Click",
        "next": [
            "Cat",
            "Dog"
        ]
    },
    "Banana": {
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}
```

Let's assume there are no apples on the screen, but there are oranges and bananas. In the above JSON, if we execute "StartFruit" (i.e., pass "StartFruit" to the MaaTaskerPostPipeline interface), it will first recognize "Apple." Since there are no apples on the screen, it will continue to recognize "Orange." If it recognizes an orange, it will start executing the "Orange" task, and it won't attempt to recognize "Banana." After executing "Orange" according to its action, it will continue to recognize "Orange's" "next" tasks.

Within "Orange's" "next," if it recognizes "Cat," it won't continue to recognize "Dog." It will execute the "Cat" action and continue to recognize "Cat's" "next" after the action is completed. If neither "Cat" nor "Dog" is recognized, it will continue to attempt recognition for these two tasks until a timeout occurs.

This loop continues until the "next" of a task is empty, which signifies that the task is complete.

## Property Fields

**Note: For required fields, they can still be empty in the Pipeline JSON file and set through the interface before actual execution.**

- `recognition`: *string*  
    Recognition algorithm type. Optional, default is `DirectHit`.  
    Possible values: `DirectHit` | `TemplateMatch` | `FeatureMatch` | `ColorMatch` | `OCR` | `NeuralNetworkClassify` | `NeuralNetworkDetect` | `Custom`.  
    See [Algorithm Types](#algorithm-types) for details.

- `action`: *string*  
    Action to execute. Optional, default is `DoNothing`.  
    Possible values: `DoNothing` | `Click` | `Swipe` | `Key` | `Text` | `StartApp` | `StopApp` | `StopTask` | `Custom`.  
    See [Action Types](#action-types) for details.

- `next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    List of tasks to execute next. Optional, default is empty.  
    It recognizes each task in sequence and executes the first one it recognizes.

- `interrupt` : *string* | *list<string, >*  
    The list of candidate tasks when all tasks in `next` are not recognized, and similar interrupt operations will be performed. Optional, empty by default.  
    If all tasks in `next` are not recognized, each task in the interrupt list will be recognized in order, and the first recognized one will be executed. After all subsequent tasks are executed, jump back to this task to try to recognize it again.  
    For example: A: { next: [B, C], interrupt: [D, E] }  
    When B and C are not recognized and D is recognized, D and D.next will be fully executed. But when the pipeline of D is fully executed. It will return to task A again and continue to try to recognize B, C, D, E.  
    This field is mostly used for exception handling. For example, D is to recognize the "network disconnection prompt box". After clicking confirm and waiting for the network connection to succeed, continue the previous task flow.

- `is_sub`: *bool*  
    **(Deprecated in version 2.x, but retains compatibility.`interrupt` is recommended instead.)**  
    Whether it is a subtask. Optional, default is false.  
    If it's a subtask, after completing this task (and subsequent tasks such as "next"), it will return to re-recognize the "next" list of this task.  
    For example: A.next = [B, Sub_C, D], where Sub_C.is_sub = true. If Sub_C is matched, after fully executing Sub_C and subsequent tasks, it will return to re-recognize [B, Sub_C, D] and execute the matching items and subsequent tasks.

- `rate_limit`: *uint*  
    Identification rate limit, in milliseconds. Optional, default 1000.  
    Each round of identification next consumes at least `rate_limit` milliseconds, and sleep will wait if the time is less than that.

- `timeout`: *uint*  
    Timeout for recognizing "next" + "interrupt" tasks, in milliseconds. Default is 20,000 milliseconds (20 seconds).  
    The detailed logic is `while(!timeout) { foreach(next + interrupt); sleep_until(rate_limit); }`

- `on_error` : *string* | *list<string, >*  
    When recognition timeout or the action fails to execute, the tasks in this list will be executed next. Optional, empty by default.
  
- `timeout_next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    **(Deprecated in version 2.x, but retains compatibility.`on_error` is recommended instead.)**  
    List of tasks to execute after a timeout. Optional, default is empty.

- `inverse`: *bool*  
    Reverse the recognition result: recognized as not recognized, and not recognized as recognized. Optional, default is false.  
    Please note that tasks recognized through this setting will have their own clicking actions disabled (because nothing was actually recognized). If there is a need, you can set the `target` separately.

- `enabled`: *bool*  
    Whether to enable this task. Optional, default is true.  
    If set to false, this task will be skipped when it appears in the "next" lists of other tasks, meaning it won't be recognized or executed.

- `pre_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between recognizing a task and executing the action. Optional, default is 200 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate tasks whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `post_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between executing the action and recognizing the "next" tasks. Optional, default is 200 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate tasks whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `pre_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between recognizing a task and executing the action. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    It will exit the action only when the screen has not had significant changes for "pre_wait_freezes" milliseconds in a row.  
    If it's an object, more parameters can be set, see [Waiting for the Screen to Stabilize](#waiting-for-the-screen-to-stabilize) for details. The specific order is `pre_wait_freezes` - `pre_delay` - `action` - `post_wait_freezes` - `post_delay`.

- `post_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between executing the action and recognizing the "next" tasks. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    Other logic is the same as `pre_wait_freezes`.

- `focus`: *bool*  
    Whether to focus on the task, resulting in additional callback messages. Optional, default is false (no messages).  
    See [Task Notifications](#task-notifications) for details.

For example, if you want to recognize whether a cat or a mouse appears in a **fixed position** in the image, and you've trained a model that supports this three-category classification, and you want to click when it recognizes a cat or a mouse but not when it recognizes a dog, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc

    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.

### `NeuralNetworkDetect`

    Possible values: `Horizontal` | `Vertical` | `Area` | `Random`  
    You can use it with the `index` field.

- `index`: *int*  
    Index to hit. Optional, default is `0`.  
    If there are N results in total, the value range of `index` is [-N, N - 1], where negative numbers are converted to N - index using Python-like rules. If it exceeds the range, it is considered that there is no result in the current identification.

For example, if you want to detect cats, dogs, and mice in an image and only click when a cat or a mouse is detected but not when a dog is detected, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc
{
    "labels": ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse"],
    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.
