# Pipeline Protocol

## Overview

```jsonc
{
    "TaskA": {
        "next: [
            "TaskB",
            "TaskC"
        ]
        // properties ...
    },
    "TaskB": {
        // properties ...
    },
    // other task ...
}
```

When we execute a task (passing the task name to the MaaPostTask interface), it will recognize the tasks in the "next" list one by one (based on the recognition settings for each task). Once a match is found, it will exit the recognition of the "next" list and proceed to execute the matched task. It's similar to traversing and comparing, and as soon as a match is found, it will break and execute the found task.

## Example

For example, let's say we have a game where different fruits, such as apples, oranges, and bananas, can appear on the screen, and we need to click them. Here's a simple JSON representation:

```jsonc
{
    "StartFruit": {
        "next": [
            "Apple",
            "Orange",
            "Banana"
        ]
    },
    "Apple": {
        "recognition": XXX,
        "action": "Click",
        // ...
    },
    "Orange": {
        "recognition": XXX,
        "action": "Click",
        "next": [
            "Cat",
            "Dog"
        ]
    },
    "Banana": {
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}
```

Let's assume there are no apples on the screen, but there are oranges and bananas. In the above JSON, if we execute "StartFruit" (i.e., pass "StartFruit" to the MaaPostTask interface), it will first recognize "Apple." Since there are no apples on the screen, it will continue to recognize "Orange." If it recognizes an orange, it will start executing the "Orange" task, and it won't attempt to recognize "Banana." After executing "Orange" according to its action, it will continue to recognize "Orange's" "next" tasks.

Within "Orange's" "next," if it recognizes "Cat," it won't continue to recognize "Dog." It will execute the "Cat" action and continue to recognize "Cat's" "next" after the action is completed. If neither "Cat" nor "Dog" is recognized, it will continue to attempt recognition for these two tasks until a timeout occurs.

This loop continues until the "next" of a task is empty, which signifies that the task is complete.

### Real Business Logic Example

As shown in the previous example, the task chain is executed sequentially.

However, in real business logic within the task pipeline, most tasks require reverse order checking. Here's an example of a typical reverse order business logic:

- Implement the business of starting an **App** and clicking a **Button** on the App's page.

- When the Button is not present on the App's page, it displays a **NoButton** message.

The normal and complete sequence is as follows:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[StartUp\nAnd\nClickButton] --> B[Start\nApp] --> C{Check\nInApp} --> |true| D{Click\nButton} --> |true| Z[Done];
    C --> |false| B;
    D --> |false| F{Find\nNoButton} --> |true| Z;
    F --> |false| C;
```

To reuse "StartApp" and "CheckInApp" and decouple the core business "ClickButton," we introduce the "is_sub" field (it is recommended to read the explanation of "is_sub" later in this document before continuing).

If you need to use the "is_sub" field for subtasks, you need to reverse the order of tasks in the task pipeline:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[StartUp\nAnd\nClickButton] --> B{Click\nButton} --> |true| C[Done];
    B --> |false| D{Flag\nNoButton} --> |true| C;
    D --> |false| E[Sub\nStartUp] --> F{Flag\nInApp} --> |true| A;
    F --> |false| G[Sub\nStartApp] --> E;
```

This is because in a reversed order check pipeline, we need to place:

1. The task's exit (i.e., the core business "ClickButton" or the next step) in the first position.
2. The task's exception check (i.e., "NoButton") in the second position.
3. The task's entry (i.e., "StartUp") as a **subtask** in the third position.
4. Subtasks (e.g., "Sub_StartUp") are treated the same way (exit: "Flag_InApp," entry: "Sub_StartApp").
5. A business that needs to be executed only once (or a limited number of times) can be placed before the task's exit, i.e., in the zeroth position for faster checking.

Here's the actual business logic JSON:

```jsonc
{
    "StartUpAndClickButton": {
        "next": [
            "Click_Button",
            "Flag_NoButton",
            "Sub_StartUp"
        ]
    },
    "Sub_StartUp": {
        "is_sub": true,
        "next": [
            "Flag_InApp",
            "Sub_StartApp"
        ]
    },
    "Sub_StartApp": {
        "is_sub": true,
        "action": "StartApp"
    },
    "Flag_InApp": {
        "recognition": "TemplateMatch",
        "template": "App.png"
    },
    "Flag_NoButton": {
        "recognition": "OCR",
        "text": "NoButton"
    },
    "Click_Button": {
        "recognition": "OCR",
        "text": "Button",
        "action": "Click"
    }
}
```

## Property Fields

- `recognition`: *string*  
    Recognition algorithm type. Optional, default is `DirectHit`.  
    Possible values: `DirectHit` | `TemplateMatch` | `FeatureMatch` | `ColorMatch` | `OCR` | `NeuralNetworkClassify` | `NeuralNetworkDetect` | `Custom`.  
    See [Algorithm Types](#algorithm-types) for details.

- `action`: *string*  
    Action to execute. Optional, default is `DoNothing`.  
    Possible values: `DoNothing` | `Click` | `Swipe` | `Key` | `Text` | `StartApp` | `StopApp` | `StopTask` | `Custom`.  
    See [Action Types](#action-types) for details.

- `next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    List of tasks to execute next. Optional, default is empty.  
    It recognizes each task in sequence and executes the first one it recognizes.

- `is_sub`: *bool*  
    Whether it is a subtask. Optional, default is false.  
    If it's a subtask, after completing this task (and subsequent tasks such as "next"), it will return to re-recognize the "next" list of this task.  
    For example: A.next = [B, Sub_C, D], where Sub_C.is_sub = true. If Sub_C is matched

, after fully executing Sub_C and subsequent tasks, it will return to re-recognize [B, Sub_C, D] and execute the matching items and subsequent tasks.

- `inverse`: *bool*  
    Reverse the recognition result: recognized as not recognized, and not recognized as recognized. Optional, default is false.  
    Please note that tasks recognized through this setting will have their own clicking actions disabled (because nothing was actually recognized). If there is a need, you can set the `target` separately.

- `enabled`: *bool*  
    Whether to enable this task. Optional, default is true.  
    If set to false, this task will be skipped when it appears in the "next" lists of other tasks, meaning it won't be recognized or executed.

- `timeout`: *uint*  
    Timeout for recognizing "next" tasks, in milliseconds. Default is 20,000 milliseconds (20 seconds).

- `timeout_next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    List of tasks to execute after a timeout. Optional, default is empty.

- `times_limit`: *uint*  
    Number of times the task is executed. Optional, default is UINT_MAX (effectively unlimited).

- `runout_next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    List of tasks to execute when the task execution limit is reached. Optional, default is empty.

- `pre_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between recognizing a task and executing the action. Optional, default is 200 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate tasks whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `post_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between executing the action and recognizing the "next" tasks. Optional, default is 500 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate tasks whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `pre_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between recognizing a task and executing the action. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    It will exit the action only when the screen has not had significant changes for "pre_wait_freezes" milliseconds in a row.  
    If it's an object, more parameters can be set, see [Waiting for the Screen to Stabilize](#waiting-for-the-screen-to-stabilize) for details. The specific order is `pre_wait_freezes` - `pre_delay` - `action` - `post_wait_freezes` - `post_delay`.

- `post_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between executing the action and recognizing the "next" tasks. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    Other logic is the same as `pre_wait_freezes`.

- `focus`: *bool*  
    Whether to focus on the task, resulting in additional callback messages. Optional, default is false (no messages).  
    See [Task Notifications](#task-notifications) for details.

- `model`: *string*  
    Model **folder** path. Use a relative path to the "model/ocr" folder. Optional, default is empty.  
    If empty, it will use the models in the root of the "model/ocr" folder. The folder should include three files: `rec.onnx`, `det.onnx`, and `keys.txt`.

### `NeuralNetworkClassify`

Deep learning classification, to determine if the image in a **fixed position** matches the expected "category."

This task property requires additional fields:

- `roi`: *array<int, 4>* | *list<array<int, 4>>*  
    Same as `TemplateMatch`.`roi`.

- `cls_size`: *int*  
    The total number of categories. Required.

- `labels`: *list<string, >*  
    Labels, meaning the names of each category. Optional.  
    It only affects debugging images and logs. If not filled, it will be filled with "Unknown."

    Currently, only ONNX models are

 supported.

- `expected`: *int* | *list<int, >*  
    The expected category index.

For example, if you want to recognize whether a cat or a mouse appears in a **fixed position** in the image, and you've trained a model that supports this three-category classification, and you want to click when it recognizes a cat or a mouse but not when it recognizes a dog, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc
{
    "cls_size": 3,
    "labels": ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse"],
    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.

### `NeuralNetworkDetect`

Deep learning object detection, an advanced version of "find image."

The main difference from classification is the flexibility to find objects at arbitrary positions. However, this often requires more complex models, more training data, longer training times, and significantly higher resource usage during inference.

This task property requires additional fields:

- `roi`: *array<int, 4>* | *list<array<int, 4>>*  
    Same as `TemplateMatch`.`roi`.

- `cls_size`: *int*  
    The total number of categories. Required.

- `labels`: *list<string, >*  
    Labels, meaning the names of each category. Optional.  
    It only affects debugging images and logs. If not filled, it will be filled with "Unknown."

- `model`: *string*  
    Model file path. Use a relative path to the "model/detect" folder. Required.  
    Currently, only YoloV8 ONNX models are supported.

- `expected`: *int* | *list<int, >*  
    The expected category index.

- `threshold`: *double* | *list<double, >*  
    Model confidence threshold. Optional, default is 0.3.  
    If it's an array, its length should match the length of the `expected` array.

For example, if you want to detect cats, dogs, and mice in an image and only click when a cat or a mouse is detected but not when a dog is detected, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc
{
    "cls_size": 3,
    "labels": ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse"],
    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.
