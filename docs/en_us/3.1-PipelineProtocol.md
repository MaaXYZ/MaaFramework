# Pipeline Protocol

## Basic Format

The task pipeline is described using JSON format and consists of several nodes. Each node contains the following core attributes:

```jsonc
{
    "NodeA": {
        "recognition": "OCR",    // Recognition algorithm
        "action": "Click",       // Action to be executed
        "next": [                // List of subsequent nodes
            "NodeB",
            "NodeC"
        ],
        // Other extended properties...
    },
    // Other node definitions...
}
```

## Execution Logic

### Process Control Mechanism

1. **Task Triggering**

   - Start the task by specifying the entry node through the `tasker.post_task` interface

2. **Sequential Detection:**

   - Perform sequential detection on the current node's `next` list
   - Attempt to identify the recognition features configured for each sub-node in sequence

3. **Interruption Mechanism:**

   - When a sub-node is successfully matched, immediately terminate subsequent node detections
   - Execute the operation defined by the matched node's `action`

4. **Successor Processing:**

   - After the operation is completed, switch the active node to the current node
   - Repeat the above detection process

### Termination Conditions

The task process terminates when any of the following conditions are met:

- The current node's `next` list is empty
- All subsequent node detections continuously fail until timeout

## Application Examples

### Scenario Description

There are menus `Display`/`Storage`/`Accessibility` in the Android settings interface, among which `Storage` contains the submenus `Games`/`Apps` after opening.

### Configuration Example

```jsonc
{
    "Start Example": {
        "next": [
            "Enter Display",
            "Enter Storage",
            "Enter Accessibility"
        ]
    },
    "Enter Display": {
        "recognition": "XXX",
        "action": "Click",
        // ...
    },
    "Enter Storage": {
        "recognition": "XXX",
        "action": "Click",
        "next": [
            "Enter Games Submenu",
            "Enter Applications Submenu"
        ]
    },
    "Enter Accessibility": {
        // ...
    },
    "Enter Games Submenu": {
        "action": "Swipe",
        "next": []
    },
    "Enter Applications Submenu": {
        // ...
    },
    // ...
}
```

## Property Fields

> [!TIP]
> **For mandatory fields, they may remain empty in the Pipeline JSON file, but must be set via the interface before actual execution.**

### Pipeline v1

- `recognition`: *string*  
    Recognition algorithm type. Optional, default is [`DirectHit`](#directhit).  
    Possible values: [`DirectHit`](#directhit) | [`TemplateMatch`](#templatematch) | [`FeatureMatch`](#featurematch) | [`ColorMatch`](#colormatch) | [`OCR`](#ocr) | [`NeuralNetworkClassify`](#neuralnetworkclassify) | [`NeuralNetworkDetect`](#neuralnetworkdetect) | [`Custom`](#custom)  
    See [Algorithm Types](#algorithm-types) for details.

- `action`: *string*  
    Action to execute. Optional, default is [`DoNothing`](#donothing).  
    Possible values: [`DoNothing`](#donothing) | [`Click`](#click) | [`LongPress`](#longpress) | [`Swipe`](#swipe) | [`MultiSwipe`](#multiswipe) | [`ClickKey`](#clickkey) | [`LongPressKey`](#longpresskey) | [`InputText`](#inputtext) | [`StartApp`](#startapp) | [`StopApp`](#stopapp) | [`StopTask`](#stoptask) | [`Command`](#command) | [`Custom`](#custom-1)  
    See [Action Types](#action-types) for details.

- `next`: *string* | *list<string, >*  
    List of nodes to execute next. Optional, default is empty.  
    It recognizes each node in sequence and executes the first one it recognizes.

- `interrupt` : *string* | *list<string, >*  
    The list of candidate nodes when all nodes in `next` are not recognized, and similar interrupt operations will be performed. Optional, empty by default.  
    If all nodes in `next` are not recognized, each node in the interrupt list will be recognized in order, and the first recognized one will be executed. After all subsequent nodes are executed, jump back to this node to try to recognize it again.  
    For example: A: { next: [B, C], interrupt: [D, E] }  
    When B and C are not recognized and D is recognized, D and D.next will be fully executed. But when the pipeline of D is fully executed. It will return to node A again and continue to try to recognize B, C, D, E.  
    This field is mostly used for exception handling. For example, D is to recognize the "network disconnection prompt box". After clicking confirm and waiting for the network connection to succeed, continue the previous node flow.  

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
     A -->|next| B
     A -->|next| C
     A -->|interrupt| D
     A -->|interrupt| E
     D -->|next| D.next...
    ```

- `is_sub`: *bool*  
    **(Deprecated in version 2.x, but retains compatibility. `interrupt` is recommended instead.)**  
    Whether it is a sub-node. Optional, default is false.  
    If it's a sub-node, after completing this node (and subsequent nodes such as "next"), it will return to re-recognize the "next" list of this node.  
    For example: A.next = [B, Sub_C, D], where Sub_C.is_sub = true. If Sub_C is matched, after fully executing Sub_C and subsequent nodes, it will return to re-recognize [B, Sub_C, D] and execute the matching items and subsequent nodes.

- `rate_limit`: *uint*  
    Identification rate limit, in milliseconds. Optional, default 1000.  
    Each round of identification "next" + "interrupt" consumes at least `rate_limit` milliseconds, and sleep will wait if the time is less than that.

- `timeout`: *uint*  
    Timeout for recognizing "next" + "interrupt" nodes, in milliseconds. Optional, Default is 20,000 milliseconds (20 seconds).  
    The detailed logic is `while(!timeout) { foreach(next + interrupt); sleep_until(rate_limit); }`

- `on_error` : *string* | *list<string, >*  
    When recognition timeout or the action fails to execute, the nodes in this list will be executed next. Optional, empty by default.

- `inverse`: *bool*  
    Reverse the recognition result: recognized as not recognized, and not recognized as recognized. Optional, default is false.  
    Please note that nodes recognized through this setting will have their own clicking actions disabled (because nothing was actually recognized). If there is a need, you can set the `target` separately.

- `enabled`: *bool*  
    Whether to enable this node. Optional, default is true.  
    If set to false, this node will be skipped when it appears in the "next" lists of other nodes, meaning it won't be recognized or executed.

- `pre_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between recognizing a node and executing the action. Optional, default is 200 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate nodes whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `post_delay`: *uint*  
    Delay in milliseconds between executing the action and recognizing the "next" nodes. Optional, default is 200 milliseconds.  
    It is recommended to add intermediate nodes whenever possible and use less delay to maintain both speed and stability.

- `pre_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between recognizing a node and executing the action. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    It will exit the action only when the screen has not had significant changes for "pre_wait_freezes" milliseconds in a row.  
    If it's an object, more parameters can be set, see [Waiting for the Screen to Stabilize](#waiting-for-the-screen-to-stabilize) for details. The specific order is `pre_wait_freezes` - `pre_delay` - `action` - `post_wait_freezes` - `post_delay`.

- `post_wait_freezes`: *uint* | *object*  
    Time in milliseconds to wait for the screen to stop changing between executing the action and recognizing the "next" nodes. Optional, default is 0 (no waiting).  
    Other logic is the same as `pre_wait_freezes`.

- `focus`: *any*  
    Focus on the node, resulting in additional callback messages. Optional, default is null (no messages).  
    See [Node Notifications](#node-notifications) for details.

- `attach`: *object*  
    Additional JSON object for storing additional node configuration. Optional, default is an empty object.  
    This field can be used to store custom configuration information that does not affect the node's execution logic but can be retrieved through related interfaces.  
    **Note**: This field will be merged with the `attach` in the default value using dict merge, not overwritten. That is, the `attach` in the node will be merged with the `attach` in the default value, where values with the same keys will be overwritten by the node's values, but other keys will be preserved.

The lifecycle of a node is as follows:

```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[enter the node] --> B[pre_wait_freezes]
        B --> C[pre_delay]
        C --> D[action]
        D --> E[post_wait_freezes]
        E --> F[post_delay]
        F --> G[recognition next and interrupt]
        G --> H{successfully identified nodes}
        H -->|yes| I[Enter a new node]
        H -->|no| J{timeout}
        J -->|yes| K[on_error]
        J -->|no| L[rate_limit]
        L --> G
```

### Pipeline v2

> [!NOTE]
> MaaFW supports Pipeline v2 protocol since version v4.4.0, and is compatible with v1.

Compared with v1, the main difference is that the fields related to `recognition` and `action` are put into the secondary dictionary (the type is put into the `type` field, and the other parameters are put into the `param` field), and the rest are the same. Example:

```jsonc
{
    "NodeA": {
        "recognition": {
            "type": "TemplateMatch",
            "param": {
                // Recognition related fields are placed in recognition.param, and the keys and values ​​remain unchanged from v1
                "template": "A.png",
                "roi": [100, 100, 10, 10]
            }
        },
        "action": {
            "type": "Click",
            "param": {
                // Action related fields are placed in action.param, and the keys and values ​​remain unchanged from v1
                "target": "XXX"
            }
        },
        // Non-recognition and action fields remain unchanged from v1
        "next": ["NodeB"],
        "pre_delay": 1000,
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Default Properties

Please refer to [`default_pipeline.json`](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaFramework/blob/main/sample/resource/default_pipeline.json)  
`Default` can set the default values ​​of all fields. And the object of algorithm/action name can set the default parameter value of the corresponding algorithm/action.

    You can use it with the `index` field.

- `index`: *int*  
    Index to hit. Optional, default is `0`.  
    If there are N results in total, the value range of `index` is [-N, N - 1], where negative numbers are converted to N - index using Python-like rules. If it exceeds the range, it is considered that there is no result in the current identification.

    If there are N results in total, the value range of `index` is [-N, N - 1], where negative numbers are converted to N - index using Python-like rules. If it exceeds the range, it is considered that there is no result in the current identification.

- `connected`: *bool*  
    Whether to count only connected points. Optional, default is false.  
    If set to true, after applying color filtering, it will only count the maximum connected block of pixels.

- `model`: *string*  
    Model **folder** path. Use a relative path to the "model/ocr" folder. Optional, default is empty.  
    If empty, it will use the models in the root of the "model/ocr" folder. The folder should include three files: `rec.onnx`, `det.onnx`, and `keys.txt`.

### `NeuralNetworkClassify`

Deep learning classification, to determine if the image in a **fixed position** matches the expected "category."

This algorithm property requires additional fields:

- `roi`: *array<int, 4>* | *string*

- `roi_offset`: *array<int, 4>*  
    Same as `TemplateMatch`.`roi_offset`.

    It only affects debugging images and logs. If not filled, it will be filled with "Unknown."

- `model`: *string*  
    Model file path. Use a relative path to the "model/classify" folder. Required.  
    Currently, only ONNX models are supported. Refer to [NNClassify Recipe](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaNeuralNetworkCookbook/tree/main/NeuralNetworkClassify).

    Possible values: `Horizontal` | `Vertical` | `Score` | `Random`
    You can use it with the `index` field.

- `index`: *int*  
    Index to hit. Optional, default is `0`.  
    If there are N results in total, the value range of `index` is [-N, N - 1], where negative numbers are converted to N - index using Python-like rules. If it exceeds the range, it is considered that there is no result in the current identification.

For example, if you want to recognize whether a cat or a mouse appears in a **fixed position** in the image, and you've trained a model that supports this three-category classification, and you want to click when it recognizes a cat or a mouse but not when it recognizes a dog, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc
{
    "labels": ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse"],
    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.

### `NeuralNetworkDetect`

Deep learning object detection, an advanced version of "find image."

The main difference from classification is the flexibility to find objects at arbitrary positions. However, this often requires more complex models, more training data, longer training times, and significantly higher resource usage during inference.

This algorithm property requires additional fields:

- `roi`: *array<int, 4>* | *string*  
    Same as `TemplateMatch`.`roi`.

- `roi_offset`: *array<int, 4>*  
    Same as `TemplateMatch`.`roi_offset`.

- `labels`: *list<string, >*  
    Labels, meaning the names of each category. Optional.  
    It only affects debugging images and logs. If not filled, it will be automatically read from the model metadata (supports reading from `names`, `name`, `labels`, `class_names` fields), generally no need to set manually. If the model metadata also doesn't contain labels, it will be filled with "Unknown."

- `model`: *string*  
    Model file path. Use a relative path to the "model/detect" folder. Required.  
    Currently supports ONNX models exported from YOLOv8 and YOLOv11. Other Yolo models with the same input/output should theoretically be supported but are untested.  
    Training reference: [NNDetect Recipe](https://github.com/MaaXYZ/MaaNeuralNetworkCookbook/tree/main/NeuralNetworkDetect).

- `expected`: *int* | *list<int, >*  
    The expected category index.

- `threshold`: *double* | *list<double, >*  
    Model confidence threshold. Optional, default is 0.3.  
    If it's an array, its length should match the length of the `expected` array.

- `order_by`: *string*  
    How the results are sorted. Optional, default is `Horizontal`  
    Possible values: `Horizontal` | `Vertical` | `Score` | `Area` | `Random`  
    You can use it with the `index` field.

- `index`: *int*  
    Index to hit. Optional, default is `0`.  
    If there are N results in total, the value range of `index` is [-N, N - 1], where negative numbers are converted to N - index using Python-like rules. If it exceeds the range, it is considered that there is no result in the current identification.

For example, if you want to detect cats, dogs, and mice in an image and only click when a cat or a mouse is detected but not when a dog is detected, the relevant fields would be:

```jsonc
{
    "labels": ["Cat", "Dog", "Mouse"],
    "expected": [0, 2]
}
```

Please note that these values should match the actual model output.

### `Custom`

Execute the recognition handle passed in through the `MaaResourceRegisterCustomRecognition` interface

This algorithm property requires additional fields:

- `custom_recognition`: *string*  
    Recognition name, same as the one passed in through the registration interface. It will also be passed through `MaaCustomRecognitionCallback`.`custom_recognition_name`. Required.

- `custom_recognition_param`: *any*

    Timeout for recognizing, in milliseconds. Optional, default is 20,000 milliseconds (20 seconds).  

## Node Notifications

The specific implementation of node notifications is determined by the upper-level UI. A message template mechanism based on JSON objects is recommended, using placeholder replacements to achieve dynamic content display.

### Message Template Mechanism

When MaaFW sends a callback message, it provides the following information:

- **message**: Message type identifier

- **details**: An object containing specific data

### Node Notification Configuration Example

```jsonc
// Configure message templates in the Pipeline
{
  "NodeA": {
    "focus": {
      "Node.Recognition.Succeeded": "{name} recognition hit, ready to start execution",
      "Node.Action.Starting": "{name} starts execution, task ID: {task_id}",
    }
  }
}

// When this node starts execution, the UI will receive a callback
{
  "message": "Node.Action.Starting",
  "details_json": {
    "task_id": 12345,
    "node_id": 67890,
    "action_id": 11111,
    "name": "NodeA",
    "focus": {
      "Node.Recognition.Succeeded": "{name} recognition hit, ready to start execution",
      "Node.Action.Starting": "{name} starts execution, task ID: {task_id}"
    }
  }
}

```

### Processing Flow

1. UI receives the node notification message sent by the framework
2. Find the corresponding template string in focus based on the message
3. Use data in details_json to replace placeholders in the template (such as `{name}`, `{task_id}`)
4. Display the processed text to the user in the interface. In the example, it displays `NodeA starts execution, task ID: 12345`

### More Message Types
