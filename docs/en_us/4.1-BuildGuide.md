# How to build

_Please note that you only need to read this chapter if you are ready to develop MaaFramework itself. If you only want to develop applications based on MaaFramework, please refer to [Quick Started](1.1-QuickStarted.md)._

## Local Development

1. Download MaaDeps prebuilt

    ```sh
    python3 tools/maadeps-download.py
    ```

2. _(macOS only)_ Download fmt

    ```sh
    sh tools/fetch-fmt.sh
    ```

3. Configure cmake

    - Windows

    ```bash
    cmake --preset "MSVC 2022"
    ```

    - Linux / macOS

    ```bash
    cmake --preset "NinjaMulti"
    ```

4. Build the project using cmake

    ```bash
    cmake --build build --config Release
    cmake --install build --prefix install
    ```

The generated binaries and related files are located in the `install` directory.

For more details, refer to [Build CI](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaFramework/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml).

## Online Development

Use Codespaces (Dev Container) to set up the basic development environment with one click (Ninja, CMake, g++-13):

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=master&repo=632024122)

Then follow the steps in [Local Development](#local-development).
