## Introduction

**MaaFramework** is a next-generation automation black-box testing framework, completely rewritten and refined based on image recognition technology and the development experience of [MAA](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights).

It offers low-code simplicity while maintaining high extensibility. The framework aims to create a rich, leading-edge, and practical open-source library, empowering developers to easily write better black-box test programs and promoting widespread use.

## Eco-Building

MAA is planned to be a category of projects rather than just a single piece of software.

If your project depends on MaaFramework, we welcome you to name it as MaaXXX, MXA, MAX, and so on. Of course, this is permission, not limitation. You can freely choose other names unrelated to MAA, depending on your own ideas!

We also welcome you to submit a PR to add your project to the best practices list above!

## License

### MaaFramework

This project is open-sourced under the [`LGPL-3.0`](./LICENSE.md) license.

### DirectML

This project supports GPU acceleration, which relies on [DirectML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/dml) on the Windows platform. DirectML is an independent component provided by Microsoft; it is not part of this project's open-source portion and is not subject to the LGPL-3.0 license. For user convenience, we have included an unmodified DirectML.dll file in the installation package. If you do not require GPU acceleration, you can safely delete this DLL file, and the core functionality of the software will remain unaffected.

## Development

_Please note that you only need to read this chapter if you are ready to develop MaaFramework itself. If you only want to develop applications based on MaaFramework, please refer to [Get Started](#get-started)._
